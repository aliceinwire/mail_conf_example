# Mail Configuration Example #

This is an example of what [my mail configuration][] looks like.  It will
probably not be especially useful to anyone without going through each file
and customizing.  I intend this to be more of a reference than a working
example.

That said, if anyone would like to contribute ideas / corrections, you are
welcome to submit pull requests.

I use the following programs:

+ [offlineimap][]: Syncs mail in local Maildirs with remote IMAP servers.
+ [imapfilter][]: Sorts mail in remote IMAP servers.
+ [mutt][]: Reads the mail.
+ [msmtp][]: Sends new mail.
+ [mairix][]: Searches mail.
+ [lbdb][]: My local address book.
+ [gnome-keyring][]: To store the credentials for IMAP / SMTP.
